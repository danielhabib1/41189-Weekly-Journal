Week 2



•	What have I learnt this week?

Through meticulous reflection into the Introduction to Human-Centred Complex Systems workshop, I have gained enlightening insights which provided a new framework when addressing a large-scale system comprising of many elements. More specifically, within week one, I have learnt the meaning of complexity, and have simultaneously been able to deconstruct a complex system through the application of reductionism. Through adapting this understanding to real-world examples such as a beehive and standing ovation taught me to recognise the relevance of this subject’s content in the future as an information systems professional. Additionally, developing a clear conception of complexity created a solid basis for the concepts introduced in the second week. Firstly, I learnt useful mechanisms when deconstructing a complex system, being a model. Thus, I have been able to understand the purpose of modelling in unpacking and interpreting large volumes of data for example identification of patterns and predictions. In building on the concept of modelling, it has been conveyed that models are a fundamental tool in converting heavy data into wisdom. However, upon reflection, a key consideration was allocating the correct number of models to provide useful results for a particular dataset. 

•	What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Upon reflecting and making comparisons between my prior and current knowledge on complex systems, it became evident that my knowledge has greatly developed. In particular, the week 2 workshop has provided be with a framework which enables me to psychologically deconstruct a multielement system into components. This is greatly beneficial as an information systems professional as it allows me to address a complex issue or idea and break it down into various subgroups, hence facilitating the development of predictability and an understanding of how it functions. Prior to this subject, my limited knowledge of modelling and reductionism created barriers when approaching large scale concepts, however, my newly developed ability to summarise and break-down the respective elements has ease the process of addressing complex systems. Further, the notion of a wisdom hierarchy was something that I didn’t know beforehand. This concept provided an understanding of how modelling can assist in transforming large volumes of data into wisdom.

•	What insights have I gained?

The week 2 workshop has provided me with various insights. Firstly, the most impactful insight gained is the realisation that the functionality and behaviour of a complex system can only be understood extensively through breaking it down and developing pattern and explanations about why the system reacts the way it does. Furthermore, the concept of the wisdom of crowds has introduced an enlightening insight. This ideology ultimately states that the human capacity for generating wisdom can be greatly enhanced as a group as opposed to the knowledge of an individual. This insight will facilitate me when approaching group tasks, as it has revealed that it is through working coherently and collaboratively that we can produce the greatest results.

•	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Through reflecting upon the week in the Introduction to Human-Centred Complex Systems, I have been able to identify both strengths and weaknesses in myself. More specifically, a heavy weakness which obstructs my ability to gain a deepened understanding of the course is my lack of prior knowledge. Throughout the second week, the introduction of various terms such as wisdom hierarchy, as well as a meticulous exploration of modelling led to the observation that my lack of knowledge in this area created gaps in my ability to understand the content. On a similar note, this led to the observation of my strength being the ability to use real-world examples to enrich my understanding. Ultimately, this strength assists in overcoming my weaknesses, as being able to develop ties between content and examples allowed a deepened and more applicable understanding of content. 

•	What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The most predominant challenged faced were grasping to concepts introduced within the lecture, particularly due to the different teaching approach taken. Whilst in past subjects, content was taught in a structured, syllabus-centred manner, the Introduction to Human-Centred Complex Systems relies more upon real-life examples and academic studies to add clarity and realism. For example, the use of the Condorcet jury theorem facilitates the teaching of the many model theory to determine the suitable number of models to produce in order to accurately explain and reason. As I have only been newly introduced to this approach, challenges arise in understanding the basic concepts needed to apply to examples. Whilst I struggled to adapt in the first week, changes have been made to my approach to this subject in order to maximise my appreciation and understanding of the subject. 

•	What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

In completing the post-work of the first workshop, it became apparent that my ability to apply concepts was limited. This stemmed from a lack of depth in understanding content. Consequently, to improve both the understanding and application of the key ideas taught, I made the decision to partake in further external research. Therefore, from these discoveries, it is evident that in order to obtain high-level results and gain an applicable understanding of content, I need to devise strategies that assist in grasping concepts in a manner that best suits by learning style.


Week 3

•	What have I learnt this week?

Upon reflection, it can be stated that throughout week 3, my conception of modelling has been deepened, taking a more human-centred focus. Ultimately, I have learnt that there are many considerations and parameters in place when modelling people due to the differing biases, perspectives and heuristic of individuals. As such, rational, behavioural and rule-based models can be used to deconstruct human psychological influences and assist in developing a realistic explanation and prediction of a hypothetical outcome. In building upon the notion of human-centred modelling, I have learnt the various problems which occur in the human-decision making process and the respective models available to best manage and make sense out of these. In addition, I have been able to gain an understanding of human behaviour through observing signals that reveal information about one’s biases and perspectives. In summation, through observing and analysing decisions e.g. purchases one is able to design human-centred models which account for individual characteristics and thus lead to the formation of more authentic and correct models. Hence, in reflecting upon the concluding slides in the workshop, the aforementioned concepts of human characteristics are viewed from a problem-solving aspect. From this, I have learnt that individual perspectives, heuristics and diversity offers a landscape which when integrated and adapted creates the potential for innovation and realignment. 

•	What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Through partaking in the process of reflection, it can be stated that throughout this week I now know how to deconstruct human characteristics and utilise them in the modelling process. More specifically, prior to this, my ability to empathise and deeply analyse signals, behaviours and heuristics in order to gain an understanding of one’s persona. Consequently, through being able to understand human behaviours I am able to create human-centred models to represent, explain and predict a hypothetical outcome. Moreover, I now know how a diverse group of individuals integrating perspective and biases can create the culmination of innovation.

•	What insights have I gained?

In reflecting upon the tutorial examples, I have been able to acquire various insights which I previously was not aware of. However, the notion of signalling is one that interested me the most. This concept is one that I was previously unfamiliar with, however, is relevant and applicable in numerous areas as an information systems professional.  Specifically, being able to use signals as a guide for modelling facilitates in the design of realistic explanations and predictions. Through the concepts taught within the second and third weeks, I have gained an insight that in some way, everything in the world can be considered a system. Ultimately reflecting over the past few weeks has revealed to me that to a certain extent, everything in the world has some sort of relationship that displays characteristics that are not found in the individual elements.

•	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Looking back throughout the many model’s workshop, I have observed both weaknesses and strengths in this topic. A personal weakness which hindered my ability to deeply engage in the newly introduced concepts is my inadequate mathematical abilities. Throughout the workshop, the modelling and decision-making topics included formula’s and other mathematical concepts to convey meaning. Whilst this would suit the learning style of some, personally my mathematical abilities make the learning of content more difficult. However, since last week, I have developed the strength to search through external resources to ensure that I learn all content in a manner which suits my learning style. This involves the integration of content and examples. Although this is exemplified in workshops, my understanding of content on a depended level occurs through learning from a variety of sources.

•	What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Having formed the official assessment groups, numerous challenges have arisen, which is largely attributable to online-based classes. Particularly, as the transition to online learning reduces face to face communication, the process of familiarising ourselves and becoming more comfortable with team members has become more difficult. Within the early stages of the semester, this does not present huge impacts as currently the primary focus is on gaining a solid conceptual understanding. However, in following week, the ability to collaborate and work coherently relies om active communication, which currently is lacking within the group. Therefore, upon reflection, it is vital that the group conducts exercises and external initiatives in order to overcome this reflection and produce out best work.

•	What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

As aforementioned, an area in which improvement in required would be team collaboration. Having been reliant on online tools for classes, assessments etc. there is extremely minimal face to face contact, or any online communication. As such, it has been difficult when addressing any misunderstandings with surrounding peers or gaining a sense of familiarity with peers to the extent where I am comfortable to ask questions.  In the coming weeks, I am eager to actively communicate with assessment group members to ensure that we are able to work coherently to perform successfully.


Week 4

•	What have I learnt this week?

Throughout this week, I have been able to utilise previously learnt content to represent human-centred complex systems. Upon reflection, the first notion introduced in this topic was system dynamic. Ultimately, my understanding is that system dynamics is an approach applied in the understanding and deconstructing complex systems through sinks, stocks, flows, rates and constants and consequently provides positive or negative feedback. An example is the economy, whereby the integration of fluctuating elements culminates to produce examinable results. In a developing and technological society, networks provide more potential for visual analysis through the identification of clusters, influences and patterns. As society develops new breakthroughs and trends such as globalisation enhances, networks provide a fundamental means of displaying connections. Additionally, agent-based models assist in understanding behaviours and interactions, predominantly through real-world simulations. An example presented within the workshop was Sims, which provides insight into human decision beyond pure mathematical methods primarily used in systems development.

•	What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Through reflection, it has been observed that the process of deconstructing models and creating forecast and explanations varies heavily in terms of complexity. Within prior, the focus on mathematical formulas and complicated concepts led to the misconception that analysis of systems can occur solely in that manner. However, this topic has provided a more familiar and understandable insight into representing complex systems. Particularly, the notion of agent-based models has introduced a completely new framework regarding systems analysis. Ultimately, I now know that representing human-centred complex systems can occur through various mediums, each of which varying greatly in complexity e.g. computer simulations.

•	What insights have I gained?

Upon reflection, it has been observed that I have acquired various new insights which facilitates my view of the world. A specific aspect of this week’s content which resonated heavily with me was agent-based models. Specifically, whilst many of the previous topics have presented new and somewhat unrelatable ideas, the concept of an agent-based model was a catalyst for my shift in thinking toward the idea of a complex system. Previously, the notion of a complex system seemed like something in which I had never made contact with. However, the computer simulation examples presented a more relatable and understandable manner.

•	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The reflection process has revealed to me that my predominant weakness is my tendency to overcomplicate the content to the extent where it hinders my understanding of content. First and foremost, although this subject is one consisting of a new outlook on the world and the introduction of complicated concepts, with solid research and active participation to workshops, it is easily understandable and very interesting. However, my focus on the complexity of the subject led to a habit of overanalysing and creating ambiguities. Particularly this week, I have developed the strength to approach the subject with an improved approach and mindset. Specifically, rather than overcomplicating content, I have been able to deconstruct the topics and make sense of various elements. This has enabled me to gain an aggregate and comprehensive conception of the introduction to human-centred complex systems. 

•	What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Upon reflection into prior weeks, it has been a common theme that the complex nature of the subjects has led to the development of ambiguities. However, various aforementioned strategies have enabled me to overcome the conceptual aspect. Through reflecting upon challenges experienced this week, it has been observed that as the semester continues, my ability to allocate the appropriate amount of time to subjects is gradually declining. Therefore, I have developed a timetable which underpins the requirements of all subjects. This ensures that I am able to address the introduction to human-centred complex systems in a holistic and systematic manner.


Week 5:

•	What have I learnt/Insights have I gained:

Through reflecting upon the fifth week in the Introduction to Human-Centred Complex System’s, I have been introduced to various concepts which facilitate my understanding of aggregate behaviour and decisions. Ultimately, this topic provides a framework which enables an information systems professional to determine accurate forecasts and projections of human behaviour through evaluating the relationship and changing interactions between agents and behaviours, and the respective outcome. The first notion addressed is probability distributions with a specific focus on aggregation. Through aggregating and compiling datasets, one is able to better their predictive potential and gain a depended understanding of human behaviour. Similarly, probability distributions enable one to predict market outcomes etc, and allows models with greater accuracy to be formulated and used to project aggregate human-decision based outcomes. Further, reflection has made it evident that the normal distribution curve displays a specific outcome of a dataset, whereby the mean, median and mode is the same. Through this data, summaries in the form of variance and standard deviation can be developed to portray the spread of outcomes for a group of variables. Finally, in a society characterised by growing connections and feedbacks, a long-tailed distribution is a situation whereby there a few individuals benefitting greatly and a large portion who are considered losers. 

•	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Upon reflection and evaluation of my performance throughout this week, it has become evident that both my prior identification of weaknesses and strategies to resolve them, has assisted in developing strengths within the subject. Specifically, in previous workshops, it was observed that a lack of depth in my understanding, failure to allocate appropriate time, and clashing learning styles were my various weaknesses. However, particularly in this week, I have noticed that the corrective steps I have taken have assisted in reducing the impact of my weaknesses and have been able to establish new ways to approach the subject to align with my personal learning style. Ultimately, through self-reflection, I have observed that my ability to target my weaknesses has allowed me to develop my strengths and gain a deeper understanding of this subject.

•	What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Looking back upon this week, the greatest challenge I have encountered is the basic understanding of python as a prerequisite for the subject. Specifically, my lack of knowledge in this area makes it difficult to comprehend various topics where python is used. Although Programming Fundamentals as provided insight into object-oriented programming, my knowledge is not yet sufficient enough to grasp content fully. Through self-evaluation, it is evident that I did not handle this challenge well, and will need to familiarise myself with python in future to assist not only with this subject, but many fundamental aspects of information systems. 


Week 6:

•	What have I learnt/Insights have I gained:

Through reflecting upon the week 6 workshop, I have gained various new insights regarding the evolution of complex systems. The first notion which initiated my understanding was path dependence, in which the actions in a particular moment depend on its preceding moments. Ultimately, path dependence occurs through the choices of prior actions, and the potential outcomes is what is path dependant. Therefore, to test the changing action of a system an urn model is used to understand various path dependencies. To consolidate this understanding, the example of random walks was used whereby the aforementioned Markov Process highlights the real-world application of this concept which states the past movement of a stock cannot be used on the projection of future movement. 
Further, I have gained insight into how the concavity and convexity of non-linear models can assist in forecasting the behaviour of complex systems.  
 
The figure above gives insight into the conclusions that can be drawn from analysing the concavity of a slope. With reference to risk aversion, it can be seen that risk averse investors utility follows a slope which declines at both low and high return potential.
Additionally, various nonlinear function has provided me with insight into the mathematical methods that can be applies to computing investment growth.
  

•	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Upon reflection, it became evident that my primary strengths and weaknesses were centred around the group assessment. Particularly, a personal weakness was my coherence when preparing for the task. As the group that I had been assigned with were all at different stages of content and preparation, this made it difficult to schedule group meeting and general communication. Personally, this can be attributed to my preference to work independently, specifically with assessed material. Therefore, at the initial stages of being assigned the task, a major weakness was my neglection of a team-based focus. The drawbacks of this approach was displayed in the first meeting, whereby we all had conflicting ideas which required compromise and elimination of ideas. However, my identification of this weakness prompted the realisation that in order to contribute effectively to this assessment, a readjustment to my approach was required. Consequently, my greatest strength within this week was to adapt my group-based views to become more cohesive and communicate my ideas rather than act independently. 

•	What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Within this week, the greatest focus was grounding a solid team dynamic that would carry through until the end of semester. However, the greatest challenge I observed was the lack of communication or preparation that members within the group carried. At stages, it became evident that only a few members within our team were motivated and eager to develop and systematic meeting schedule, whilst others did not participate within conversations. Within the early stages of the week, this did not raise heavy concern as timing wasn’t a major issue. However, as the week continued and the same problem was occurring it became evident that in order to heighten team coherence, active communication was a necessity. In response, a message was sent which addressed the flaws within our group and strategies that should be implemented to alleviate these issues. These included structured meeting times, a whole group focus and ice breakers to encourage familiarity between each other.
